The task
We need you to develop a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.
What the trek?! Don’t worry, it’s an expansion on the classic, made popular by
The Big Bang Theory, just a few additional rules;
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
The program should take a player gesture as input, and using random behaviour
generate a counter gesture, and calculate the winner. Easy! Or is it??
